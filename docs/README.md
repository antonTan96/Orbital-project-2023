## Motivation 
As a student in general, there is a lot to be done academically, and other commitments may add on to the list of things to keep track of.

 Pre-allocating time to do these tasks also is a skill of its own. Moreover, the uncertainty of the future may heavily disrupt said plans. By randomizing the process of choosing what to do, we can set our mind on what we should be doing on the spot and leave suspense to what users should do next.


Further down the line, when doing group projects we may encounter situations where one of the members “forget” to do their part. By adding the functionality of letting others assign tasks to you, we can at least attempt to avoid such situations.


## Aim 
Inspired by the meme of dads going to buy milk for an unspecified amount of time, this app aims to remind users of their responsibilities, while giving them the flexibility of choosing what to do first. In the event that one has difficulties selecting a task, the system will return suggestions.


This app also aims to improve the collaboration experience between humans by the feature of sending tasks and providing a hopefully unique user experience.

## User Stories:
* As a student who has missed the deadline of my assignment, I find it useful to have a to-do list that helps me remember my assignments.
* As a web app developer, I need a to-do list to note down all the components needed to complete a project. 
* As a group project leader, I need to make sure that members are aware of what they have to do to contribute to our project.

## Scope of project:
The web app provides an interface for people to list out their ongoing tasks as well as reminding them about the deadlines. People also have the option to send tasks to people they know with consent.

## Features:
* To-do list: Help remembering the tasks
* Reminder: Remind you to do the tasks
* Sending Tasks to contacts: Let people add tasks for you

## Tech stack:
* Nodejs (JavaScript runtime)
* React, CSS (Frontend) 
* Express (Backend)
* Postman (Backend API Testing) 
* MySQL (Database) 
* Microsoft Azure (Hosting service provider) 
* Git, GitHub (Codebase)
